## Techdegree Project Description
  Many websites do more than just give you information. Sites like GitHub, Zillow, Mint and Treehouse let users do things. They act like programs you run on your computer. These web applications, often include pages for looking at your profile, what you've done in the week or what you need to get done. These "dashboards" act like your control panel for controlling the web app.

  In this project, you'll take a mockup and a few icons and build a beautiful, web dashboard complete with JavaScript-driven charts and graphs. You only need to take the design and create the HTML, CSS and JavaScript functionality for this one page -- you don't need to create other pages, or build any backend or database functionality.

  **NOTE:** _The Front End Web Development Techdegree is meant to train you in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and let you practice and show your mastery of these fundamental building blocks of the web. Because of that, please avoid using frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Skeleton, and so on for this project. Even though you may end up using frameworks like these professionally, you still need to know and be able to implement designs with your own knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript._

  _In addition, please avoid submitting any projects that rely on a server-side technology like PHP or Ruby on Rails._
